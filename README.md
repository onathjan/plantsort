# PlantSort ðŸŒ±

PlantSort is a Rails 8 application designed to help gardeners organize and manage plants grown food, medicine, etc. With a structure reminiscent of a spreadsheet but more visually dynamic, PlantSort enables users to categorize plants by types like "Annual," "Perennial," "Fruit," "Vegetable," and "Medicinal." Users can create, edit, and categorize plants, allowing them to filter and view their collection by specific criteria. PlantSort brings a more interactive, gardener-friendly approach to plant organization than a typical spreadsheet.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts (using Rails 8â€™s built-in authentication).
- Plant Management: Users can add, edit, and delete plants.
- Categorization: Assign plants to multiple categories for better organization.
- Filter by Category: Quickly filter plants by categories using Turbo and Stimulus for a smooth user experience.
