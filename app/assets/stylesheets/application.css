* This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css.
*
* With Propshaft, assets are served efficiently without preprocessing steps. You can still include
* application-wide styles in this file, but keep in mind that CSS precedence will follow the standard
* cascading order, meaning styles declared later in the document or manifest will override earlier ones,
* depending on specificity.
*
* Consider organizing styles into separate files for maintainability.
